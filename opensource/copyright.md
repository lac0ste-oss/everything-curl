## Copyright

Copyright is a legal right granted by the law of a country that gives the
creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and distribution.

The copyright owner(s) can agree to allow others to use their work by
licensing it. That is what we do in the curl project. The copyright is the
foundation on which the licensing works.

Daniel Stenberg is the owner of most copyrights in the curl project.

## Independent

A lot of Open Source projects are run within umbrella organizations. Such
organizations include the GNU project, the Apache Software Foundation, a
larger company that funds the project or similar. The curl project is not part
of any such larger organization but is completely independent and free.

No company controls curl's destiny and the curl project does not need to
follow any umbrella organization's guidelines.

curl is not a formal company, organization or a legal entity of any kind. curl
is just an informal collection of humans, distributed across the globe, who
work together on a software project.

## Legal

The curl project obeys national laws of the countries in which it works. However,
it is a highly visible international project, downloadable and usable in
effectively every country on earth, so some local laws could be broken
when using curl. That is just the nature of it and if uncertain, you should check
your own local situation.

There have been law suits involving technology that curl provides. One such
case known to the author of this was a patent case in the US that insisted
they had the rights to resumed file transfers.

As a generic software component that is usable everywhere to everyone, there
are times when libcurl—in particular—is used in nefarious or downright
malicious ways. Examples include being used in virus and malware software. That
is unfortunate but nothing we can prevent.
