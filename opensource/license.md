curl and libcurl are distributed under an Open Source license known as a MIT
license derivative. It is short, simple and easy to grasp. It follows here in

This is legalese that says you are allowed to change the code, redistribute
the code, redistribute binaries built from the code and build proprietary code
with it, without anyone requiring you to give any changes back to the
project—but you may not claim that you wrote it.

Early on in the project we iterated over a few different other licenses before
we settled on this. We started out GPL, then tried MPL and landed on this MIT
derivative. We will never change the license again.
