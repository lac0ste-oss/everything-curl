# Modify the HTTP request

As described earlier, each HTTP transfer starts with curl sending an HTTP
request. That request consists of a request line and a number of request
headers, and this chapter details how you can modify all of those.

* [Request method](modify/method.md)
* [Request target](modify/target.md)
* [Fragment](modify/fragment.md)
* [Customize headers](modify/headers.md)
* [Referer](modify/referer.md)
* [User-agent](modify/user-agent.md)

Of course, changing the [HTTP version](versions.md) is another way to alter
the request.
