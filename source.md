# The source code

The source code is, of course, the actual engine parts of this project. After
all, it is a software project.

curl and libcurl are written in C.

## Hosting and download

You can always find the source code for the latest curl and libcurl release on
the [official curl website](https://curl.se/). From there you can also
find alternative mirrors that host copies and there are checksums and digital
signatures provided to help you verify that what ends up on your local system
when you download these files are the same bytes in the same order as were
originally uploaded there by the curl team.

If you instead would rather work directly with the curl source code off our source
code repository, you find all details in [the curl GitHub
repository](https://github.com/curl/curl/).

## Clone the code

    git clone https://github.com/curl/curl.git

This will get the latest curl code downloaded and unpacked in a directory on
your local system.
