# --trace and --trace-ascii

There are times when `-v` is not enough. In particular, when you want to store
the complete stream including the actual transferred data.

For situations when curl does encrypted file transfers with protocols such as
HTTPS, FTPS or SFTP, other network monitoring tools (like Wireshark or
tcpdump) will not be able to do this job as easily for you.

For this, curl offers two other options that you use instead of `-v`.

`--trace [filename]` will save a full trace in the given file name. You can
also use '-' (a single minus) instead of a file name to get it passed to
stdout. You would use it like this:

    $ curl --trace dump http://example.com

When completed, there is a 'dump' file that can turn out pretty sizable. In
this case, the 15 first lines of the dump file looks like:

    == Info: Rebuilt URL to: http://example.com/
    == Info:   Trying 93.184.216.34...
    == Info: Connected to example.com (93.184.216.34) port 80 (#0)
    => Send header, 75 bytes (0x4b)
    0000: 47 45 54 20 2f 20 48 54 54 50 2f 31 2e 31 0d 0a GET / HTTP/1.1..

    0040: 70 74 3a 20 2a 2f 2a 0d 0a 0d 0a                pt: */*....
    <= Recv header, 17 bytes (0x11)
    0000: 48 54 54 50 2f 31 2e 31 20 32 30 30 20 4f 4b 0d HTTP/1.1 200 OK.
    0010: 0a                                              .
    <= Recv header, 22 bytes (0x16)
    0000: 41 63 63 65 70 74 2d 52 61 6e 67 65 73 3a 20 62 Accept-Ranges: b
    0010: 79 74 65 73 0d 0a                               ytes..

Every single sent and received byte get displayed individually in hexadecimal
numbers. Received headers will be output line by line.

If you think the hexadecimals are not helping, you can try `--trace-ascii
[filename]` instead, also this accepting '-' for stdout and that makes the 15
first lines of tracing look like:

    == Info: Rebuilt URL to: http://example.com/
    == Info:   Trying 93.184.216.34...
    == Info: Connected to example.com (93.184.216.34) port 80 (#0)
    => Send header, 75 bytes (0x4b)
    0000: GET / HTTP/1.1
    0010: Host: example.com

    0000: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    0000: Accept-Ranges: bytes
    <= Recv header, 31 bytes (0x1f)
    0000: Cache-Control: max-age=604800

## --trace-time

This options prefixes all verbose/trace outputs with a high resolution timer
for when the line is printed. It works with the regular `-v / --verbose`
option as well as with `--trace` and `--trace-ascii`.

An example could look like this:

    $ curl -v --trace-time http://example.com
    23:38:56.837164 * Rebuilt URL to: http://example.com/
    23:38:56.841456 *   Trying 93.184.216.34...
    23:38:56.935155 * Connected to example.com (93.184.216.34) port 80 (#0)
    23:38:56.935296 > GET / HTTP/1.1
    23:38:56.935296 > Host: example.com
    23:38:56.935296 > User-Agent: curl/7.45.0
    23:38:56.935296 > Accept: */*
    23:38:56.935296 >
    23:38:57.029570 < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    23:38:57.029699 < Accept-Ranges: bytes
    23:38:57.029803 < Cache-Control: max-age=604800
    23:38:57.029903 < Content-Type: text/html
    ---- snip ----

The lines are all the local time as hours:minutes:seconds and then number of
microseconds in that second.
