# HTML and charsets

curl will download the exact binary data that the server sends. This might be
of importance to you in case, for example, you download a HTML page or
other text data that uses a certain character encoding that your browser then
displays as expected. curl will then not translate the arriving data.

A common example where this causes some surprising results is when a user
downloads a web page with something like:

    curl https://example.com/ -o storage.html

â€¦and when inspecting the `storage.html` file after the fact, the user realizes
that one or more characters look funny or downright wrong. This might occur
because the server sent the characters using charset X, while your editor and
environment use charset Y. In an ideal world, we would all use UTF-8
everywhere but unfortunately, that is still not the case.

A common work-around for this issue that works decently is to use the
common `iconv` utility to translate a text file to and from different
charsets.
