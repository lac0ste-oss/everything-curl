# Reading email

There are two dominant protocols on the Internet for reading/downloading email
from servers (at least if we do not count web based reading), and they are IMAP
and POP3. The former being the slightly more modern alternative. curl supports
both.

## POP3

To list message numbers and sizes:

    curl pop3://mail.example.com/

To download message 1:

    curl pop3://mail.example.com/1

To delete message 1:

    curl --request DELE pop3://mail.example.com/1

## IMAP

Get the mail using the UID 57 from mailbox 'stuff':

    curl imap://server.example.com/stuff;UID=57

Instead, get the mail with index 57 from the mailbox 'fun':

    curl imap://server.example.com/fun;MAILINDEX=57

List the mails in the mailbox 'boring':

    curl imap://server.example.com/boring

List the mails in the mailbox 'boring' and provide user and password:

    curl imap://server.example.com/boring -u user:password

## TLS for emails

POP3 and IMAP can both be done over a secure connection and both can be done
using either explicit or implicit TLS. The "explicit" method is probably the
most common approach and it means that the client connects to the server using
an insecure connection and *upgrades* it to TLS as it goes, using the
`STARTTLS` command. You tell curl to attempt this with `--ssl` or if you want
to *insist* on a secure connection you use `--ssl-reqd`. Like this:

    curl pop3://mail.example.com/ --ssl-reqd

or

    curl --ssl imap://mail.example.com/inbox

"Implicit" SSL means that the connection gets secured already at first
connect, which you make curl attempt by specifying a scheme in the URL that
uses SSL. In this case either `pop3s://` or `imaps://`. For such connections,
curl will insist on connecting and negotiating a TLS connection already from
the start, or it will fail its operation.

The previous explicit examples done with implicit SSL:

    curl pop3s://mail.example.com/

or

    curl imaps://mail.example.com/inbox
