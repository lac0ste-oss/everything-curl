# Introduction

*Everything curl* is an extensive guide for all things curl. The project, the
command-line tool, the library, how everything started and how it came to be
the useful tool it is today. It explains how we work on developing it further,
what it takes to use it, how you can contribute with code or bug reports and
why millions of existing users use it.

This book is meant to be interesting and useful to both casual readers and
somewhat more experienced developers. It offers something for everyone to pick
and choose from. 

Do not try to read it from front to back. Read the chapters or content you are
curious about and flip back and forth as you see fit.

I hope to run this book project as I do all other projects I work on: in the
open, completely free to download and read. I want it to be free for anyone to
comment on, and available for everyone to contribute to and help out with.

Send your bug reports, pull requests or critiques to me and I will improve
this book accordingly.

This book will never be finished. I intend to keep working on it. While I
may at some point consider it fairly complete, covering most aspects of the
project (even if only that seems like an insurmountable goal), the curl
project will continue to move so there will always be things to update in the
book as well.

This book project started at the end of September 2015.

## The book sites

[https://everything.curl.dev](https://everything.curl.dev) is the home of this
book. It features accessible links to read the book online in a web version,
or download a PDF version for offline reading. Unfortunately, the previously
provided ebook formats are no longer provided by gitbook.com that we use to
produce the book.

[https://github.com/bagder/everything-curl](https://github.com/bagder/everything-curl)
hosts all the book content.

## The author

With the hope of becoming just a co-author of this material, I am Daniel
Stenberg. I founded the curl project and I am a developer at heart—for fun and
profit. I live and work in Stockholm, Sweden.

All there is to know about me can be found on [my web
site](https://daniel.haxx.se/).
