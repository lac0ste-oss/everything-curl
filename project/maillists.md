## Mailing lists

Some of the most important mailing lists are…

### curl-users

The main mailing list for users and developers of the curl command-line
tool, for questions and help around curl concepts, command-line options, the
protocols curl can speak or even related tools. We tend to move development
issues or more advanced bug fixes discussions over to curl-library instead,
since libcurl is the engine that drives most of curl.

See https://lists.haxx.se/listinfo/curl-users

### curl-library

The main development list, and also for users of libcurl. We discuss how to
use libcurl in applications as well as development of libcurl itself. You will
find lots of questions on libcurl behavior, debugging and documentation
issues.

See https://lists.haxx.se/listinfo/curl-library

### curl-announce

This mailing list only gets announcements about new releases and security
problems—nothing else. This one is for those who want a more casual feed of
information from the project.
