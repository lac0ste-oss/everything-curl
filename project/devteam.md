## The development team

Daniel Stenberg is the founder and self-proclaimed leader of the
project. Everybody else that participates or contributes in the project has
thus arrived at a later point. Some contributors worked for a while and then
left again. Most contributors hang around only for a short while to get their
bug fixed or feature merged or similar. Counting all contributors we know the
names of, we have received help from more than 2,500 individuals.
