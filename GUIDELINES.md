# Writing guidelines

This is a collection of guidelines and rules we try to adhere to when writing
and editing "Everything curl".

## Capitalization of words in section names

We do not use that practice, partially because our sections are not really
"chapters", but also to create a more informal feel.

## Avoid prepositions at the end of sentences

This is not a hard rule, but we should strive to avoid it.

## Avoid colloquial contractions like it'll, must've, might've, should've

Spell them out as "it will" and "must have", etc.

## - vs — (typographical em dash)

And ... vs … (typographical ellipses)

Let's try to use the correct UTF-8 characters!

## Avoid the short forms of dir and repo

They are instead called "directory" and "repository".

## Internet with a capital I

Still the proper name of the one we all know and love. The same goes for other
proper names like Linux, Unix, Windows (the OS), and JavaScript.

## Avoid using command-line options in titles or subtitles

Use an English phrase instead. This is not a man page.

## Use backticks around libcurl constants

For example, `CURLE_OK` and `CURLOPT_URL`.
