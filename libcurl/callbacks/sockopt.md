# sockopt callback

The sockopt callback is set with `CURLOPT_SOCKOPTFUNCTION`:

    curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_SOCKOPTFUNCTION, sockopt_callback);

The `sockopt_callback` function must match this prototype:

    int sockopt_callback(void *clientp,
                         curl_socket_t curlfd,
                         curlsocktype purpose);

This callback function gets called by libcurl when a new socket has
been created but before the connect call, to allow applications to change
specific socket options.

The **clientp** pointer points to the private data set with
`CURLOPT_SOCKOPTDATA`:

    curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_SOCKOPTDATA, custom_pointer);

This callback should return:

 - CURL_SOCKOPT_OK on success
 - CURL_SOCKOPT_ERROR to signal an unrecoverable error to libcurl
 - CURL_SOCKOPT_ALREADY_CONNECTED to signal success but also that the socket is
   in fact already connected to the destination
