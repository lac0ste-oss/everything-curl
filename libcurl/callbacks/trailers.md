# Sending trailers

"Trailers" is a HTTP/1 feature where headers can be passed on *at the end of a
transfer*. This callback is used for when you want to send trailers with curl
after an upload has been performed. An upload in the form of a chunked encoded
POST.

The callback set with `CURLOPT_TRAILERFUNCTION` will be called and the
function can then append headers to a list. One or many. When done, libcurl
sends off those as trailers to the server.
