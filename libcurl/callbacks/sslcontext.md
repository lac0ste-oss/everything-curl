# SSL context callback

libcurl offers a special TLS related callback called
`CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION`. This option only works for libcurl powered by
OpenSSL, wolfSSL or mbedTLS and it does nothing if libcurl is built with
another TLS back-end.

This callback gets called by libcurl just before the initialization of a TLS
connection after having processed all other TLS related options to give a last
chance to an application to modify the behavior of the TLS initialization. The
`ssl_ctx parameter` passed to the callback in the second argument is actually
a pointer to the SSL library's `SSL_CTX` for OpenSSL or wolfSSL, and a pointer
to `mbedtls_ssl_config` for mbedTLS. If an error is returned from the callback
no attempt to establish a connection is made and the operation will return the
callback's error code. Set the `userptr` argument with the
`CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA` option.

This function gets called on all new connections made to a server, during the
TLS negotiation. The TLS context will point to a newly initialized object each
time.
