# Get a simple HTML page

This example just fetches the HTML from a given URL and sends it to
stdout. Possibly the simplest libcurl program you can write.

By replacing the URL this will of course be able to get contents over other
supported protocols as well.

Getting the output sent to stdout is a default behavior and usually not what
you actually want. Most applications will instead install a [write
callback](../callbacks/write.md) to have receive the data that arrives.

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <curl/curl.h>

    int main(void)
    {
      CURL *curl;
      CURLcode res;

      curl = curl_easy_init();
      if(curl) {
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com/");

        /* Perform the request, res will get the return code */
        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
        /* Check for errors */
        if(res != CURLE_OK)
          fprintf(stderr, "curl_easy_perform() failed: %s\n",
                  curl_easy_strerror(res));

        /* always cleanup */
        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
      }
      return 0;
    }
