# Get a HTML page in memory

This example is a variation of the former that instead of sending the received
data to stdout (which often is not what you want), this example instead stores
the incoming data in a memory buffer that is enlarged as the incoming data
grows.

It accomplishes this by using a [write callback](../callbacks/write.md) to
receive the data.

This example uses a fixed URL string with a set URL scheme, but you can of
course change this to use any other supported protocol and then get a resource
from that instead.
