# libcurl for C++ programmers

libcurl provides a C API. C and C++ are similar but not the same. There are a
few things to keep in mind when using libcurl in C++.

## Strings are C strings, not C++ string objects

When you pass strings to libcurl's APIs that accept `char *` that means you
cannot pass in C++ strings or objects to those functions.

For example, if you build a string with C++ and then want that string used as
a URL:

    std::string url = "https://example.com/foo.asp?name=" + i;
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url.c_str());

## Callback considerations

Since libcurl is a C library, it does not know anything about C++ member
functions or objects. You can overcome this "limitation" with relative ease
using for a static member function that is passed a pointer to the class.

Here's an example of a write callback using a C++ method as callback:

    // f is the pointer to your object.
    static size_t YourClass::func(void *buffer, size_t sz, size_t n, void *f)
    {
      // Call non-static member function.
      static_cast<YourClass*>(f)->nonStaticFunction();
    }

    // This is how you pass pointer to the static function:
    curl_easy_setopt(hcurl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, YourClass::func);
    curl_easy_setopt(hcurl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, this);
