# libcurl examples

The native API for libcurl is in C so this chapter is focused on examples
written in C. But since many language bindings for libcurl are thin, they
usually expose more or less the same functions and thus they can still be
interesting and educational for users of other languages, too.

 * [Get a simple HTTP page](examples/get.md)
 * [Get a page in memory](examples/getinmem.md)
 * [Submit a login form over HTTP](examples/login.md)
