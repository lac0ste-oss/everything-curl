## Cleanup

In previous sections we have discussed how to setup handles and how to drive
the transfers. All transfers will, of course, end up at some point, either
successfully or with a failure.

### Multi API

When you have finished a single transfer with the multi API, you use
`curl_multi_info_read()` to identify exactly which easy handle was completed
and you remove that easy handle from the multi handle with
`curl_multi_remove_handle()`.

If you remove the last easy handle from the multi handle so there are no more
transfers going on, you can close the multi handle like this:

    curl_multi_cleanup( multi_handle );

### easy handle

When the easy handle is done serving its purpose, you can close it. If you
intend to do another transfer, you are however advised to rather reuse the
handle rather than to close it and create a new one.

If you do not intend to do another transfer with the easy handle, you simply
ask libcurl to cleanup:

    curl_easy_cleanup( easy_handle );
